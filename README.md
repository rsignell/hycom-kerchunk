# hycom-kerchunk
Notebooks to create and access HYCOM Open Data on AWS as a virtual dataset using kerchunk-generated references.  

The Conda environment I used for the notebook ( `pangeo_notebook_env.yml` ) could probably be stripped down a lot if you just want to run the notebooks in this repo (I use this "pangeo" environment for almost everything I do on the ESIP Nebari deployment).  

The Conda environment I'm using on Coiled was generated by:
```
coiled env create --name esip-pangeo-arm --workspace esip-lab --conda pangeo_coiled_env.yml --architecture aarch64
```
